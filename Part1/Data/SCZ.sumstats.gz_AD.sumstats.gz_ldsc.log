Please note that the results initially printed to the screen and log file reflect the NON-liability h2 and cov_g. However, a liability conversion is being used for trait /Users/guillermocomesanacimadevila/Desktop/PhD/Part1/Data/SCZ.sumstats.gz when creating the genetic covariance matrix used as input for Genomic SEM and liability scale results are printed at the end of the log file.
